# Hema Devi U

Hey! I'm Hema, a Blockchain developer with a keen interest in decentralized applications and smart contracts. I hold a degree in Computer Science and Engineering and have been actively involved in blockchain development for over a year. My journey began with an awe for decentralization, and since then, I've been dedicated to learning, experimenting, and building some cool stuff on Ethereum. I am currently leaning to audit smart contracts and make web3 safer :)

## Iâ€™m currently working on

- **[Efficient-Uniswapv2]:** Better than Uniswap v2 DEX, that is more gas efficient and robust than uniswapv2.

## Projects I enjoyed

- **[Raffle](https://github.com/HemaDeviU/Raffle-Dapp):** A decentralized application for a provably fair lottery.
- **[AMM](https://github.com/HemaDeviU/DEX):** A decentralized application for a provably fair lottery.

## Skills

- Solidity
- Smart Contract Auditing
